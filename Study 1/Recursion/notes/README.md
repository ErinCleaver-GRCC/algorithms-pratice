Recursion
  *  A way of solving the problem by having a function calling itself
  *  Performing the same operation multiple times with different inputs.
  *  In every step we try smaller inputs to make the problem smaller
  *  Base condition is needed to stop the recursion otherwise, an infinite loop will occur.
