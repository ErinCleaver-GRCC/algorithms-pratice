# Recursion in Python

Recursion
  *  A way of solving the problem by having a function calling itself
  *  Performing the same operation multiple times with different inputs.
  *  In every step we try smaller inputs to make the problem smaller
  *  Base condition is needed to stop the recursion otherwise, an infinite loop will occur.
Why you use Resursion?
  1.  Recursive thinking is really important in programming and it helps you break down a big problem into smaller ones and is eaiser to use. 
      - When to choose Recursion.
        *  if you can divine the problem into similar sub problems.
        *  Design n algorithm to compute nth...
        *  Write code to list the n...
        *  Implement a method to compare all 
        *  Practice
        *  under 10000 uses
  2.  The prominent useage of recursion in data structures like trees and graphs.
  3.  Ask questions related to recursion during the interviews
  4.  It is used in many algorithms (divide and conquer, greedy and dyamic programming).
How Recursion Works?
  1.  A method or function that calls itself depneding on the programming lanagure 
  2.  The Recursion method or function must exit from the inifnite loop
