Section 2:  algorithms - Recursion

Memory Management
  *  Stack Memory
    *  The Stack Memory is a special region in the RAM (Random access memory)
    *  This is a special data type (stack) that store the active functions and local variables as well.
    *  This is how Python knows where to return after finishing the execution of a given function. 
  * Heap Memory
    *  The heap memory is a special region in the region in the RAM (Random access memory) as well
    *  The size of the heap memory is way larger than that of stack memory (we can store more items)
    *  Objects are stored on the heap memory.
