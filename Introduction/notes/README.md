What are Data Structures
  *  Data Structures are different ways of organizing data on your computer that can be used effectively.
What is an algorithm? 
  *  Set of steps to accomplish a task.
Algorithms in Computer Science
  *  Set of rules for a computer program to accomplish a task.
     1.  Input Data
     2.  Calculation
     3.  Stop when the answer is found.
How to make a good algorithm?
  1. The problem is solved correctly
  2. The problem is solved efficiently
Why are Data Structures and Algorithms in Interviews?
  *  Shows problem solving skills
  *  Fundamental concepts of programming in a limited time.
Types of Data Structures
  *  Primitive Data Structures
     *  Integer
     *  Float
     *  Character
     *  String
     *  Boolean
  *  Non-Primitive Data Structures
     *  Linear Data Structures
        *  Static
           *  Arrays
        *  Dynamic
           *  Linked List
           *  Stack
           *  Queue
     * Non Linear Data Structures
       * Tree
       * Graph
Types of Algorithms
  *  Simple Recursive algorithms
     *  Calls itself recursively     
  *  Divide and Conquer algorithms
     *  Divide the program into smaller subproblems of the same type, and solve these subproblems recursively.
     *  Combine the solutions to subproblems into a solution to the original problem
     *  Quick Sort
     *  Merge Sort
  *  Dynamic programming Algorithms
     *  They work based on memorization
     *  To find the best solution
  *  Greedy Algorithms
     *  We take the best we can without worrying about future consequences
     *  We hope that by choosing a local optimum solution at each step, we will end up at a global optimum solution.
  *  Brute force algorithms
     *  It simply tries all possibilities until a satisfactory solution is found.
  *  Randomized Algorithms
     *  Use a randomized number at least once during computation to make decisions.
